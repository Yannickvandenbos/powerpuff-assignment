# The Powerpuff Girls assignment

## Introduction

Dear developer,

Thank you for taking the time to review my code. I've had fun creating this project to showcase some of the skills I currently have.

Please find more information about this project below.

### Project setup

The project contains three main features:

- Home - Here you can search for any series in the database and view your search result

- Show - Here you can view details for a specific show you clicked on from the home page. This page contains all key information about a show and all episodes.

- Episode - Here you can view details about a specific episode you click on from the show page.

Each route in the /app folder contains it's own structure. You can find feature / route specific components and hooks here. This way it is easy to know what code belongs to which feature.

The src contains global and reusable code, such as components, hooks, stores, styles and types. This code is used by multiple features and therefore put in the global src folder for easy reusability.

### How to get started

Starting this project should be fairly easy. Steps to get started:

- Pull this project to your local machine from the GIT repository
- Run `npm install` in the root of the project to install the packages from `package.json`
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server and view the project in your browser at `localhost:3000`

Thank you for reading the documentation and reviewing the code.
